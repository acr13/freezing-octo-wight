<p>One-on-One With Roccy</p>

<p>How did I learn what I needed to learn in order to write my Bad Advisors book?</p>

<p>Imagine if you could take 2.5 years off of work to research advanced estate planning, life insurance and annuities, stock market risk, long-term care, Medicaid planning, asset protection, income tax planning strategies, etc. That&rsquo;s essentially what I was able to do back in 1998.<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="images/badadvisorcover.jpg" style="float:right; height:300px; margin:8px; width:221px" /></p>

<p>Research and aligning myself with the best experts in their fields</p>

<p>In addition to the 2.5 years of hard core research I did back in 1998, for the last 9+ years I&rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of my time not trying to make money selling products or services; but instead I spent a significant amount of time researching any and every topic/concept/product I could find that affects a person&rsquo;s wealth.</p>

<p>Many times I am able to research topics/concepts/products on my own, but many times I&rsquo;ve had to recruit others to help me break them down. I&rsquo;ve been very lucky that some of the top experts in their fields (law, tax planning, insurance, annuities, etc.) have given me their time to help me learn various subjects and break down different topics/concepts/products that need to be reviewed.</p>

<p>When you have the desire to research and have the best resources in the country help along the way, there is little wonder why I&rsquo;m able to bring a unique perspective to the book Bad Advisors.</p>
